# 🛠️ Mini Frontend Projects – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

### Small projects, deep learning.

Welcome to my collection of small and simple web apps built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. These mini projects are designed to help me **master DOM manipulation**, understand **core frontend concepts**, and improve the **performance and interactivity** of web applications.

## 📌 Projects Included

1. ✅ **To-Do App** – Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete using dynamic DOM updates.
2. 🔍 **Search & List App** – Filter and display a list of items in real-time based on user input.
3. 🖱️ **Custom Cursor App** – Replace the default cursor with a unique design that follows user movement and interaction.

## 🎯 Motivation

These projects may be small, but they dive into key areas of frontend development:

- DOM selection and manipulation  
- Event handling and delegation  
- Dynamic styling and class toggling  
- Performance and user experience (UX) optimization  

Each app is crafted to reinforce specific frontend techniques while keeping things fun and hands-on.
